# Music_App

Implemented Deezer API integration in a music app, utilizing Retrofit for network communication (Retrofit version 2.9.0) and Gson converter for parsing JSON responses. 
Additionally, employed Picasso (version 2.8) for rendering images from API links within a RecyclerView for a seamless user experience.
